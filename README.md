Exercise

Created a controller implementing methods for create, update, delete and read bookings from in-memory volatile database (apache-ignite v2.15.0)
A booking is when a guest selects a start and end date and submits a reservation on a property.
A block is when the property owner or manager selects a range of days during which no guest can make a booking (e.g. the owner wants to use the
property for themselves, or the property manager needs to schedule the repainting of a few rooms).
Blocks can overlap with each other.
Blocks can't overlap a booking.



The database is running on 127.0.0.1:10800
The server is configurated to work on 127.0.0.1:9000
Tested on Centos 7
Developed with Netbeans16

sql file to create a database is booking_ext.sql


To run the application:

download apache-ignite binaries and extract to eg:/usr/local
download maven and extract to eg: /usr/local
follow provider instructions to install both

open a terminal
Go to $IGNITE_HOME/bin
execute ./ignite.sh

open a new terminal
Go to $IGNITE_HOME/bin
execute ./ignite.sh

open a new terminal
Go to $IGNITE_HOME/bin
execute ./sqlline.sh -u jdbc:ignite:thin://127.0.0.1/
write a username eg: admin
write a password eg: admin
execute !run path_to_booking_ext.sql
execute !q

Go to the project directory
execute mvn spring-boot:run
